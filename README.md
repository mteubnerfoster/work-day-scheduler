# Work Day Scheduler
I created a calendar application that allows users to enter and save events for each hour of their work day, starting at 8am and ending at 5pm.
This app runs in the user's browser and features dynamically updated HTML and CSS, powered by jQuery.

I used the Moment.js library to generate date and time. 

* When users open the planner, the current day is displayed at the top of the calendar
* When users scroll down, they are presented with time blocks for standard business hours
* Each time block is color coded to indicate if it is in the past, present, or future
* Users can enter their events when clicking in a time block
* Users can save their time block entries by clicking the 'save' button, and it will be saved in their local storage
* When the page is refreshed, the saved events remain on the page
